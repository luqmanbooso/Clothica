# Clothica (minimal)

- Frontend: React (client/)
- Java backend: Spring Boot (Emp/)
- Node backend: Express (server/)

Quick start:
- `cd client && npm start` for the React app.
- `cd Emp && mvn spring-boot:run` for the Spring API (install Maven first).
- `cd server && npm run dev` for the Node API (MongoDB required).

Notes:
- Promotions/events/loyalty endpoints are currently disabled.
- Campaign Hub is simplified to a placeholder banner/discount UI.
